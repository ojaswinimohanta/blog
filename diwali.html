    <h3> Why is Diwali called the Festival of Lights?</h3>
    The word "Deepavali" consists of two words. "Deep" means light and "vali" means "a row".<br> Thereby, "Deepavali"
    means "a row of lights". Popular as the "Festival of Lights", <br>Deepavali signifies the victory of light over
    darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.<br>
    It is celebrated on the 15th day of Kartika (October/November). <br>
    This festival commemorates Lord Rama's return to his
    kingdom Ayodhya after completing his 14-year exile. The most beautiful of all 
    Indian festivals, Diwali is a
    celebration of lights.<br>
    Diwali is also an important festival in Jainism. For the Jain community, the festival
     commemorates the enlightenment
    and liberation (moksha) of Mahavira, the most recent of the Jain Tirthankaras, 
    from the cycle of life and death
    (samsara). <br>The lighting of the lamps celebrates the light of Mahavira's holy
     knowledge.<br>
    Observed by more than a billion people across faiths, this five-day festival of
     lights brings prayer, feasts,
    fireworks and, for some, a new year. Diwali is India's most important festival of
     the yearâ€”a time to celebrate the
    triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil
    </P>
    <p>Deepawali or Diwali, is a festival of lights symbolising the victory of
         righteousness and the lifting of
        spiritual darkness. ... This festival commemorates Lord Rama's
         return to his kingdom Ayodhya after completing
        his 14-year exile. The most beautiful of all Indian festivals, 
        Diwali is a celebration of lights.</p>
